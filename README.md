# 👋 Hi, I'm Yvonne Kirschler

I work with data where structure matters. With a background in IT Service Management and a growing focus on Data Science, I build projects that aim to turn complexity into clarity — and raw data into something useful.

My current work combines modeling, analysis, and automated reporting. The goal: to create solutions that are reproducible, explainable, and grounded in real-world processes.
